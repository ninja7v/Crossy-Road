📃 INSTRUCTIONS
============
## 🚀Execution
Crossy Road uses the folowing Pascal units:
- [Crt](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Crt)
- [Dos](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/dos/index.html)
- [Keyboard](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/keyboard/index.html)
- [Sysutils](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/sysutils/index.html)
 
To execute it, compile the "CrossyRoad.pas" file and run it. After launching the program, a terminal windows pops up.

## ⚙️Menu

Everything happens in the terminal. Select the option you want using ↑ and ↓ arrows (or '8' and '2' keys if the VERR NUM buton is desactivated), then press SPACE BAR to validate. Any other key won't do anything.

The first step is choosing the color of your character. 2 options are White and blue. Finaly, commands to play are ↑, ↓, →, ← arrrows. Resizing the window may errase the grid. After loosing, if the score is among the top 3, a pseudo is asked. After that 2 options are comeback to the menu or exit the program.

## 🥇 Scores
Scores are saved in the "score_crossyroad.txt" file. If this file doesn't exist, it is created. It is possible to rest scores in the score option.
